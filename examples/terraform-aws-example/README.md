# Terraform AWS Example

This folder contains a simple Terraform module that deploys resources in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to demonstrate
how you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your AWS Terraform code. This module deploys an [EC2
Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and gives that Instance a `Name` tag with the value specified in the
`instance_name` variable.

Check out [test/terraform_aws_example_test.go](/test/terraform_aws_example_test.go) to see how you can write
automated tests for this module.

Note that the EC2 Instance in this module doesn't actually do anything; it just runs a Vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 AMI for
demonstration purposes. For slightly more complicated, real-world examples of Terraform modules, see
[terraform-http-example](/examples/terraform-http-example) and [terraform-ssh-example](/examples/terraform-ssh-example).

**WARNING**: This module and the automated tests for it deploy real resources into your AWS account which can cost you
money. The resources are all part of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), so if you haven't used that up,
it should be free, but you are completely responsible for all AWS charges.
