# Terraform Machine Learning Example

This folder contains a simple Terraform module that deploys resources in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to demonstrate
how you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your Azure Terraform code. This module deploys an Azure Machine Learning Workspace and Azure Machine Learning Compute Cluster.

- [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2e)

Check out [test/azure/terraform_azure_machine_learning_example_test.go](/test/azure/terraform_azure_machine_learning_example_test.go) to see how you can write
automated tests for this module.

Note that the resources deployed in this module don't actually do anything; it just runs the resources for
demonstration purposes.

**WARNING**: This module and the automated tests for it deploy real resources into your Azure account which can cost you
money. The resources are all part of the [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), so if you haven't used that up,
it should be free, but you are completely responsible for all Azure charges.
